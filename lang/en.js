    description: `Dreams are magical messages that help us get closer to ourselves.

How to understand the language of dreams? If you have ever wondered about this question, our bot is for you!

Night Insight will help you explore the world of dreams, uncover their deep meaning, and reveal the secrets of your subconscious.

While it cannot replace a consultation with a psychotherapist, the bot will become your faithful assistant in dream exploration and provide you with the opportunity to understand their language.

Simply describe your dream, and Night Insight will suggest what may be hidden behind its images.`,

  reccomendations: [
    `Keeping a dream journal helps show your unconscious that your intentions are "serious" and that you are ready to listen to it and see more dreams.`,

    "Write down the dream immediately upon waking up. If you have difficulty writing by hand, use a voice recorder, and then transfer the dream to a notebook or our bot.",

    "Learn to connect dream events with current events. In the dream journal, it is also useful to describe in a couple of sentences what is happening in your daily life.",

    "Do not evaluate: useful/not useful, good/bad - it's not about that. A dream can reveal much more meaning when you stop judging it.",

    "Record dreams in the present tense. Using the past tense is a defensive mechanism that often serves to create a barrier between the waking Ego and the dream experience.",

    "Use the address to the inner Master of Dreams and set your intention to remember. For example, before sleep, you can briefly formulate a question that you would like the unconscious to answer.",

    "Give your dreams a brief title when recording them.",

    "Do not impose restrictions on methods of interacting with your dreams. The more creativity is manifested in communication with the unconscious, the more energy can potentially be released from such work.",

    `Do not ignore dream fragments and snippets. Often, a "fragment" is a symbol that memory has carefully edited to make the symbolic representation as economical and clear as possible. At the same time, it is the brightest thing that memory has preserved. The feeling that the dream is incomplete and therefore unimportant comes from the mistaken ego setting for the desire for completeness and the plot structure typical of works of art.`,

    "Relive your dreams in active imagination, as well as from the perspective of different characters. Record these new images on paper and occasionally revisit them.",

    "Imagine different scenarios in which your dream could continue if you hadn't woken up.",

    "Periodically go back and review your dreams. You will be surprised how significant a dream that you dreamt a long time ago, which happened to come to hand, can be.",

    "Practice meditative techniques in waking life. If you imagine that you are sleeping right now, what images in the surrounding reality would you pay attention to? How would you retell this dream, what is it about?",

    "Do not be afraid of nightmares. The feelings that arise from a dream are the reaction of the Ego, which often has a protective character and prevents you from seeing the true message of the unconscious.",
